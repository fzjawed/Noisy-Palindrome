Should I just get Spotify Premium? 💆‍ Also omg I really gotta start going to the gym ahahahahahah my schedule is a mess.

Also I sort of broke my streak on binarysearch but I had a streak freeze so it isn't actually broken. Thank god :)

So check out this question:

***Question: You are given a string s containing lowercase and uppercase alphabet characters as well as digits from "0" to "9". Return whether s is a palindrome if we only consider the lowercase alphabet characters.***

Basically what I did is extract the lower case letters and append it to a seperate list. If the reverse of that list was the same as the original list I return true.
